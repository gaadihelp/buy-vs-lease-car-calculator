### What Does It Mean to Lease or Buy a Car?

Before using the calculator, it’s important to understand the difference between leasing and buying.

#### Buying a Car

When you buy a car, you either:
- Pay the full amount upfront, or
- Finance it with a loan

Once the loan is paid off, you own the car completely. You can keep it, sell it, or trade it in.

#### Leasing a Car

Leasing is like renting. You:
- Pay monthly to use the car for a fixed term (usually 2–4 years)
- Return the car at the end unless you choose to buy it

You don’t build ownership through leasing, but your payments are typically lower than financing.

### Real-Life Example Using the Calculator

Let’s say the car you want costs **$30,000**.

#### If You Lease:
- Lease term: 3 years
- Monthly payment: $400
- Down payment: $3,000
- End-of-lease purchase option: $15,000

**Total Lease Cost** (excluding purchase): around **$17,400**

#### If You Buy:
- Loan term: 5 years
- Monthly payment: $550
- Down payment: $3,000
- Interest rate: 5%
- Resale value after 5 years: $12,000

**Total Buying Cost** (after resale): around **$21,000**

In this case, leasing is cheaper up front, but buying becomes better if you plan to keep the car for many years after the loan is paid.

### When Should You Lease?

Leasing may be better if:
- You want a new car every few years
- You don’t drive more than 10,000 to 15,000 miles per year
- You want lower monthly payments
- You prefer not to deal with long-term maintenance

---

### When Should You Buy?

Buying might be better if:
- You plan to keep the car for 5 years or more
- You drive a lot and don’t want to worry about mileage limits
- You want to build equity and eventually stop making payments
- You want the freedom to modify or sell the vehicle
